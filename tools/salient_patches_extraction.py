    """
    Extracts patches from an input image using K-means clustering on features obtained from a pre-trained MobileNet
    V3 model.

        Args:
            i_in (torch.Tensor): Input image tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width).
            n_clusters (int, optional): Number of clusters for K-means. Default is 16.
            patch_size (int, optional): Size of the patches to be extracted. Default is 256.
            kmeans_centers_fn (function, optional): Function to initialize K-means cluster centers.
                Default is regular_chessboard_initialization.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Extracted patches of shape (n_clusters, channels, patch_size, patch_size).

        Note: - The MobileNet V3 model used here is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. - The input image is split
        into patches, which are then passed through the pre-trained MobileNet V3 model to obtain feature
        representations. - The features are further reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to 3 dimensions
        for clustering. - K-means clustering is performed on the reduced feature space to group similar patches into
        clusters. - For each cluster, the patch that is closest to the cluster center in the reduced feature space is
        selected. - The selected patches from each cluster are returned as the output.
